Write a function that displays the character passed as a parameter.



#include <unistd.h>

void	ft_putchar(char c)
{
	write(1, &c, 1);
}


#include <unistd.h> // library that contains write function

void	ft_putchar(char c) // ft_putchar is a function that takes a character, c, as an input argument
{
	write(1, &c, 1); // write is a function that has 3 arguments, the first arg 1 means that it uses the standard output, which by default is generally the terminal. The second, &c is the location of the array of characters, c. The third, 1 is the number of bytes, this means that it writes only 1 byte or 1 char at a time.
